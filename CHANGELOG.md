## [v0.22.0] -- 2026-08-25 (Release)

This release finishes the responsive-snapshot workstream: Bubble Tea now keeps the large UI model
behind a pointer, snapshot installation reuses model-owned buffers, and small content-only changes
rebuild only the affected list items. The fast path is guarded by deterministic fingerprints and
falls back to a full rebuild whenever graph topology, recipe membership, sort order, or more than
20% of issues changes.

### Delivered capability: Faster UI Updates

- **Stop copying the entire model on every message.** The TUI model and its hot navigation helpers
  now use pointer receivers, eliminating the roughly 198 KB interface-boxing copy that previously
  accompanied each `Update`. On the 1,000-issue snapshot-swap benchmark, the measured handler moved
  from **105-225 us** before this work to **4.076-4.284 us**, a **24.5x-55.2x latency reduction**;
  bytes per operation fell by about **99.8%**. See
  [`96029793`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/96029793) and
  [`1a90b016`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/1a90b016).
- **Keep interactive latency inside the frame budget.** Five update-only keypress runs measured
  p99 at **148-160 us**. Three isolated update-plus-render runs measured p99 at
  **33.05-35.54 ms**, below the 50 ms interaction target. Isolated GC validation measured maximum
  pauses of **0.879-1.374 ms**. The benchmarks live with the code in
  [`5aac8532`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/5aac8532) and the broader
  regression coverage in [`d5a1be08`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/d5a1be08).
- **Precompute immutable view inputs off the UI loop.** Snapshots now carry list-model items,
  semantic-search documents, alert summaries, graph data, and stable ID/order indexes so delivery
  does not reconstruct these structures during rendering. See
  [`b24297fc`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/b24297fc).

### Delivered capability: Correct Incremental List Rebuilds

- **Detect changes deterministically.** Issue fingerprints distinguish nil from present zero-value
  fields, ignore nil dependency entries, canonically order tied comments, and classify simultaneous
  content and dependency changes exactly once. See
  [`16ed4342`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/16ed4342).
- **Reuse unchanged work only when it is safe.** A change at or below the 20% threshold uses the
  incremental list path only when recipe identity, membership, order, and dependency topology are
  unchanged. Additions, removals, dependency edits, recipe changes, reordered results, and larger
  diffs automatically take the full path. Incremental and full results are compared directly in
  tests, including recipe and topology fallbacks.
- **Measured result:** on an AMD EPYC-Milan worker, five paired 1,000-item runs reduced one-change
  list construction from **374.9-412.4 us** to **189.1-212.6 us** (**1.76x-2.18x faster**).
  Allocations fell from **1,001 to 2 per operation** (**99.8% fewer**). The remaining approximately
  516 KB/op is the immutable output slice itself and is not claimed as eliminated.

### Reliability, Integration, and Operator Improvements

- Make background-worker cancellation and recovery ownership thread-safe, with lifecycle and idle-GC
  coverage in [`2a2ec14e`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/2a2ec14e) and
  [`3e6473bb`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/3e6473bb).
- Copy interactive graph node descriptions without mutating Beads, including clipboard fallbacks
  for offline dashboards ([`f2e6c9da`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/f2e6c9da)).
- Generate tracker-neutral v4 agent guidance with current `bd` and `br` command families, backed by
  integration coverage ([`b9ae1472`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/b9ae1472)).
- Keep fallback and Nix version sources aligned through a release invariant test
  ([`70adf7f8`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/70adf7f8)).

### Verification Boundary

- Passed `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, the complete analysis package, focused incremental race
  tests (three repetitions), and all non-environment-sensitive packages through RCH.
- The RCH environment runs as root, rewrites the working directory, and lacks usable VCS metadata;
  seven permission/cwd/timing tests were therefore excluded from the aggregate remote run after
  their failure modes were reproduced and classified. The E2E package passed separately with
  `GOFLAGS=-buildvcs=false` propagated into its nested build.

### Added

- **Copy graph node descriptions without mutating Beads.** The exported interactive graph's
  right-click menu can now copy either a node ID or its raw description. Both actions share a
  clipboard fallback for local/offline dashboards and report empty descriptions or copy failures
  instead of silently doing nothing.
- **Generate correct agent guidance for both Beads trackers.** `bv --agents-add` now installs a
  tracker-neutral v4 blurb with separate, current `bd` and `br` command families, rather than
  telling Go Beads workspaces to mutate their tracker with `br`.

---

## [v0.21.2] -- 2026-08-24 (Release)

Published release: [GitHub Release v0.21.2](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/releases/tag/v0.21.2).
This release publishes the profile-driven work staged under the tag-only `v0.21.1`, plus the
final Nix packaging correction. The campaign completed all 50 requested iterations, but credits
only improvements that survived command-level measurement, output-equivalence checks, focused
causal tests, and the full Go verification suite.

### Delivered capability: Faster Cold Robot Triage

- **Profile the real bottleneck first.** On the pinned 540-issue / 19-open Git fixture, history
  correlation accounted for 62.26% of command CPU and snapshot extraction for 58.49%. Within that
  path, profiles attributed roughly 100 ms to large allocations, 70 ms to clearing memory, and
  70 ms to background garbage collection. This ruled out speculative graph and JSON tuning as the
  first lever.
- **Recycle a blob only after its last reader is gone.** Snapshot record sets contain slices that
  point directly into their Git blob buffer, so reusing a live buffer would silently corrupt
  history. The extractor already knew each blob's last use. Commit
  [`22305d12`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/22305d1208d2d17671f34beb480b68489fcb4a1c)
  made that lifetime explicit: evict the record set first, then place its backing buffer in a
  one-slot, largest-capacity spare owned by the streaming `git cat-file --batch` reader. The next
  blob re-slices that storage when it fits instead of allocating and zeroing another large byte
  array. Only one spare is retained, so reuse stays bounded rather than becoming a memory cache.
- **Preserve the algorithm, remove allocation churn.** Git object order, the one-response-at-a-time
  protocol, line identity, event ordering, and the existing two-to-three-snapshot live window from
  [#182](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/issues/182) did not change. Four-snapshot
  lifetime tests prove that two live blobs never alias and that only an
  explicitly recycled buffer is reused. A real-history differential reproduced all 1,776 legacy
  events, and 20 independently normalized robot outputs were identical at SHA-256
  `5992ff99901b1c5abf8ccf3b1a9e3d2490a6f0eda1742cad938e7b3ff9809918`.
- **Measured result:** ten independent low-load, interleaved cold-cache pairs reduced mean user CPU
  from **0.647 s to 0.573 s (11.44%)**, with 10/10 wins and exact sign `p=0.00098`. Five traced
  pairs reduced mean GC cycles from **25.8 to 13.0 (49.61%)**. Wall time improved 2.26% but missed
  significance (`p=0.0547`), while peak RSS increased 0.177%; therefore this release claims lower
  CPU and GC work, **not** lower wall latency or memory usage.

### Delivered capability: Reused Graph Analysis

- **What-if batches:** [`4b685960`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/4b685960)
  added a stats-consuming path so `--robot-insights` can pass the completed `GraphStats` it already
  owns. Previously a planted 540-issue batch performed 540 redundant analysis-cache decodes through
  `TopWhatIfDeltas -> computeWhatIfDelta -> Analyze`. The focused same-worker benchmark moved from
  **4.4108 s / 1.648 GB / 8,530,586 allocations** to **3.203–16.564 ms / 1.444–4.931 MB /
  8,504–26,341 allocations**. This is a scoped batch benchmark, not a whole-command latency claim.
- **Cycle-break insights:** [`5b73a6b6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/5b73a6b6)
  routes the handler's completed statistics into advanced-insight generation instead of launching
  another analysis merely to recover the same cycle list. Sentinel-cycle tests prove the supplied
  statistics control the result, while nil callers retain the ordinary analyze-on-demand fallback.
- **Direct dependency decoding:** [`a83bf01c`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/a83bf01c)
  reduced a direct-loader benchmark by 13.00% and allocations by 33.63% while replaying malformed
  and invalid-UTF-8 inputs through the standard library for exact behavior. It did not improve the
  dominant cold-correlation command path, so it is not included in the 11.44% release claim.

### Closed workstreams: Measurement and Negative Evidence

- Fixed registry-backed CPU-profile shutdown in
  [`854a8070`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/854a8070) and
  [`0a0838ec`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/0a0838ec), ensuring profiling
  completes before robot dispatch exits instead of leaving zero-byte or truncated profiles.
- Ran 50 bounded optimization passes. PGO, `GOAMD64=v3`, fixed GC pacing, smaller transport
  buffers, direct event fusion, prefetch windows, alternate record tables, and other promising
  candidates were rejected when end-to-end confidence intervals crossed zero, system CPU or tails
  regressed, memory worsened, or the active profile placed too little cost in the proposed seam.
  These results and retry conditions remain in the pinned
  [hotspot table](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/blob/v0.21.2/tests/artifacts/perf/HOTSPOT_TABLE.md)
  and [negative-evidence ledger](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/blob/v0.21.2/tests/artifacts/perf/HYPOTHESIS_LEDGER.md).
- Retained snapshot frontier/allocation refinements have differential coverage, but no additional
  release-wide percentage is assigned to them. The only accepted cold-triage result from this
  campaign is buffer reuse's 11.44% user-CPU and 49.61% GC-cycle reduction.

### Representative commits

- [`22305d12`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/22305d1208d2d17671f34beb480b68489fcb4a1c)
  — recycle evicted Git blob buffers on the measured cold-correlation path.
- [`4b685960`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/4b685960) — consume
  completed graph statistics across what-if batches.
- [`5b73a6b6`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/5b73a6b6) — reuse
  completed cycle data in advanced insights.
- [`854a8070`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/854a8070) and
  [`0a0838ec`](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer/commit/0a0838ec) — make robot
  CPU profiles complete and trustworthy.

### Fixed and Packaged

- Document the explicit Nix unfree-package opt-in required by the project's OpenAI/Anthropic
  license rider, keeping the published flake instructions consistent with its corrected nonfree
  metadata.
- Publish five platform archives with individual SHA-256 sidecars, aggregate checksums, an SPDX
  SBOM, and the DSR build manifest. Publicly downloaded macOS and Windows binaries reported
  `bv v0.21.2`; the Go module proxy resolved `v0.21.2` to the tagged source commit.

---

## [v0.21.1] -- 2026-08-24 (Tag only)

Staging tag only; no GitHub Release or binary assets were published for `v0.21.1`. Its performance,
profiling, differential-test, and license-metadata changes were published immediately afterward as
the `v0.21.2` release and are documented above. The version bump was necessary because the
`v0.21.1` tag was already immutable when the final Nix usage correction landed.

---

## [v0.21.0] -- 2026-08-23 (Release)

### Changed — **BREAKING (robot JSON semantics)**

- **Strict count semantics in triage output (#165).** `quick_ref.open_count` /
  `project_health.counts.open` now count ONLY issues whose status is exactly `open` (previously:
  every non-closed issue, i.e. `open`+`in_progress`+`blocked`+`deferred`), and
  `quick_ref.blocked_count` / `counts.blocked` now count ONLY issues whose status is exactly
  `blocked` (previously: every non-closed, non-actionable issue). Both now always equal the
  corresponding `counts.by_status` entries. The legacy aggregates are preserved under
  semantically accurate names: `not_closed_count` / `counts.not_closed` (old `open_count`) and
  `not_actionable_count` / `counts.dependency_blocked` (old `blocked_count`), with the partition
  invariant `not_closed == actionable + not_actionable`. Consumers that relied on
  `counts.open` meaning "non-closed" must switch to `not_closed`; consumers that relied on
  `counts.blocked` meaning "dependency-blocked" must switch to `dependency_blocked` /
  `not_actionable_count`. This also aligns the triage counts with the bundled viewer's strict
  status tiles.

### Changed

- **Better `.gitignore` handling (#179, revisiting #34/#151).** `bv` no longer unconditionally
  appends `.bv/` to the repo's committed `.gitignore`. It now prefers **`.git/info/exclude`**
  (no repo litter, invisible to collaborators, shared across linked worktrees — worktree
  `.git` pointer files and their `commondir` indirection are resolved), skips writing entirely
  when the project is not a git repository or when `.bv` is already covered by the repo
  `.gitignore`, `.git/info/exclude`, or the user's global gitignore (`core.excludesFile` from
  the global git config, or the `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore` default). A new
  `BV_NO_GITIGNORE` environment variable (any non-empty value) disables all ignore-file
  management. Everything remains pure file I/O — no `git` subprocess, no git-binary
  dependency — and `bv` still never deletes or rewrites existing ignore entries; appending to
  `.gitignore` survives only as a last-resort fallback when `.git` exists but the exclude file
  is unusable.

### Added

- **Reliable light/dark theme selection (bv-128, idea from PR #178).** New `--theme` flag
  (`light` | `dark` | `auto`) plus a top-level `theme:` key in `~/.config/bv/config.yaml`,
  resolved once at startup with the precedence `--theme` → `BV_THEME` → config → auto-detect.
  The resolved preference is now applied to the **global** lipgloss renderer
  (`lipgloss.SetHasDarkBackground`), fixing the pre-existing `BV_THEME` override, which only
  touched per-model renderers while the bulk of the UI (package-global styles, badges, glamour
  markdown) kept auto-detecting — and auto-detection falls back to *dark* whenever the terminal
  doesn't answer the background query (common over SSH and in `tmux`/`screen`), leaving light
  terminals with near-white, unreadable text and no working escape hatch. Invalid `--theme`
  values warn on stderr and resolve to auto-detect.

- **Bounded robot liveness for the triage history prologue (#166).** The git-history correlation
  step of `--robot-triage` / `--robot-next` now runs under a hard budget (default 10 s),
  overridable via `--robot-history-timeout-ms` or `BV_ROBOT_HISTORY_TIMEOUT_MS` (`0` =
  unbounded). On timeout the in-flight git subprocess is killed (the correlation package now
  threads a `context.Context` into every `git` invocation via `exec.CommandContext`) and triage
  proceeds without history. The outcome is surfaced as `meta.history_status`
  (`ok` | `error` | `timeout`; omitted when history generation was not attempted).

---

## [v0.17.0] -- 2026-06-08 (Release)

Performance release: a profile-driven overhaul of the agent-facing robot path makes repeat
`--robot-*` calls roughly **25× faster** (warm triage ~2.3 s → ~0.09 s) and cuts git
subprocesses from ~340 to 3 — all while keeping output byte-identical (verified by golden and
differential tests). Also bundles the correctness fixes and a fresh-eyes bug-review pass found
during the optimization work, plus a routine dependency refresh.

### Added

- **TUI:** left-click now focuses a panel and selects the row under the cursor, with precise
  geometry inversion for split and single-column list views (drags and out-of-range clicks are
  ignored) (bv-162).

### Performance — Robot Path (`--robot-triage` / `--robot-next` / `--robot-plan` / `--robot-insights`)

- **Correlation (the dominant former hotspot):** replaced ~2 `git show` per commit with 2 batched
  `git log` calls; extract bead lifecycle via deduped `--raw` blob snapshots instead of
  `git log -p`; added a persistent correlation result cache keyed on HEAD + beads-hash + opts so
  repeat calls skip git extraction entirely. Cold-path: split the cache so working-tree bead edits
  no longer bust the HEAD-only extraction, and added content-addressed per-commit **event** and
  **co-commit** caches keyed by immutable commit SHA, so advancing HEAD only processes the new
  commits (#160, #161).
- **Analysis disk cache:** no longer rewrites the whole cache file on a read-hit; switched to
  goccy/go-json streaming codec; adopted a columnar struct-of-arrays on-disk shape (v2, ~44 %
  smaller).
- **Loader / datasource:** parse `issues.jsonl` once on the robot path (fused load + validation
  via a typed probe), memoize the data hash per invocation, and added a size-gated
  (≥ 4 MiB) parallel JSONL parse for large stores.

### Fixed

- **triage:** exclude unblocked parent-child rollup edges from `blocked_by` (#158).
- **watch:** coalesce `--watch-export` with adaptive backoff and skip exports via the canonical
  content + dependency hash (#159).
- **Fresh-eyes review (output-preserving):** restored commit `BeadID`s dropped from the HEAD
  artifact cache; rejected a fresher empty/non-issue JSONL from shadowing the real `issues.jsonl`;
  fixed parallel-parser `ParseStats` merge and an off-by-one max-capacity line boundary; stopped a
  transient git failure from poisoning the co-commit cache; fixed a possible `readBlobs` deadlock
  on a `cat-file` parse error; fixed a negative-index panic and a per-commit cache self-wipe.

### Dependencies

- Updated 7 direct dependencies (`git.sr.ht/~sbinet/gg`, `mattn/go-runewidth`,
  `golang.org/x/{image,sync,sys,term}`, `modernc.org/sqlite`) and re-vendored canonically. See
  `UPGRADE_LOG.md`.

---

## [v0.16.2] -- 2026-05-16 (Release)

Patch release focused on updater correctness, release artifact reliability, and hardening fixes found during fresh-eyes review passes.

### Updater & Versioning
- Ignore update notices whose release tag is equal to or older than the running version, including tags with stray whitespace.
- Clear stale in-session update banners when a later update check resolves to the current version.

- Avoid redundant update checks after a recent successful check.
- Accept stable release archive names in the updater.

### Build & Release
- Align GoReleaser archive names with README `latest/download` aliases, publish Windows as a zip archive, and update the GoReleaser config to v2 syntax.
- Keep direct download aliases reproducible and version-aliased.
- Keep GoReleaser snapshot builds from double-prefixing versions as `vvX.Y.Z-next`.

### Tests
- Harden background worker tests by waiting on worker state instead of fixed sleeps.

### Robustness
- Preserve completed history searches and coalesce queued background refreshes in the TUI.
- Resolve historical `--as-of` dates from commit history and filter stale data sources by true newest time.
- Harden correlation batch-stat locking, git stream progress callbacks, EOF handling, temporal author filters, and tombstone lifecycle classification.
- Safely pair agent blurb removal markers.
- Recover stale unreadable instance locks.

### Search, Hooks, Analysis & Export
- Score all bead statuses in hybrid search mode.
- Reject malformed hook timeout values.
- Normalize loaded feedback data for analysis.

- Avoid shell browser launchers on Windows and strengthen GitHub deployment helper behavior before force-with-lease pushes.

---

## [v0.16.1] -- 2026-05-14 (Release)

Patch release focused on dependency freshness, vendored reproducibility, and release metadata cleanup.

### Dependencies

- Verify the local `/dp/toon-go` dependency is already at the latest local commit used by `go.mod`.
- Update Rust/WASM lockfiles and move `bv-graph-wasm` to `getrandom` 0.4 with the `wasm_js` feature.

### Build & Release
- Refresh fallback, Nix, README latest-download aliases, and changelog release metadata for `v0.16.1`.
- Restrict ACFS notification workflow triggers to `main`.
- Keep transient `.beads/.write.lock` files ignored and out of release commits.
