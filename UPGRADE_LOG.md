# Dependency Upgrade Log

**Date:** 2026-10-04 | **Project:** beads-viewer-edit (human-edit fork) | **Upstream:** v0.25.0 -> v0.25.1 (4db2f8dc)

## Summary

- **Method:** merge of upstream `v0.25.1` into the fork's `main`, as for v0.25.0. Upstream's change is moderate (89 files: sidebar layout, tracker-source selection, history/correlation, dashboard). None of it restructures the fork's hooks in `pkg/ui/model.go`, and every fork hunk applied cleanly.
- **Version:** `pkg/version/version.go` fallback is upstream's `v0.25.1` (it came in with the merge); the `bv (edit)` prefix in `--version` output is unchanged.
- **Conflicts resolved:**
  - `.beads/*`: kept untracked (fork does not track upstream's tracker data; local files left in place).
  - `pkg/drift/drift_test.go`: took upstream's version. Upstream pinned the probe analyzer to the test clock, the same fix the fork made in v0.25.0.
  - `UPGRADE_LOG.md`: fork entries on top, upstream's "v0.25.0 published" status below.
  - `.goreleaser.yaml`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, `Makefile`: upstream did not touch them; they are identical to the fork's `main`. No release-gate files came back.
- **Semantic fixups:**
  - `tests/e2e/docs_parity_test.go`: upstream's new `TestDocsParity_ConfiguredCoverageThresholds` reads `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which the fork removed. It now skips when that file is missing.
  - Checked: upstream's sidebar layout (GH #209) keeps overlays full-width; the fork's edit picker is in that overlay chain.
- **Validation:** `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` clean. `go test ./...`: all packages pass except `tests/e2e` `TestRobotCycleSuggestionRepairsImportedTracker`, the same pre-existing failure as in v0.25.0. The locally installed `br` fails `dep remove` with "database is busy (recovery in progress)"; bv's suggestion output in that test is correct. `go test ./tests/e2e/ -skip TestRobotCycleSuggestionRepairsImportedTracker` passes.

**Date:** 2026-09-30/10-01 | **Project:** beads-viewer-edit (human-edit fork) | **Upstream:** v0.22.0 -> v0.25.0 (87cee25)

## Summary

- **Method:** merge of upstream `v0.25.0` into the fork's `main` (same approach as the v0.19.0 and v0.22.0 merges). Upstream heavily restructured `pkg/ui/model.go`, `pkg/updater/updater.go` and `pkg/loader/loader.go`, but the fork's edits to those files are small hooks; the human-edit code lives in its own files.
- **Version:** `pkg/version/version.go` fallback is upstream's `v0.25.0`; the `bv (edit)` prefix in `--version` output is unchanged. Upstream raised the build minimum to Go 1.26 (toolchain `go1.26.8`).
- **Conflicts resolved:**
  - `.beads/*`: kept untracked (fork does not track upstream's tracker data).
  - `.goreleaser.yaml`: upstream build block (`CGO_ENABLED=0`, `GOWORK=off`, `-buildvcs`, release-gate hook) plus the fork's static-binary comment.
  - `pkg/loader/loader.go`: upstream's `beadsMetadata` (adds `database`); the fork's `jsonl_export` preference is kept.
  - `pkg/ui/model.go`: upstream now runs `br update` asynchronously after editor exit (`runBRUpdateCmd`). It now takes the configured `editConfig.BrPath`, and a successful update triggers the fork's immediate reload.
  - `pkg/updater/updater.go`: kept the fork release URL (`stevelr/beads-viewer-edit`).
  - `pkg/ui/update_keys_test.go`: kept both upstream's graph tests and the fork's edit tests.
- **Semantic fixups:**
  - `pkg/ui/human_edit.go`: upstream turned the attention view into a focus mode (`focusAttention`), so `showAttentionView` was removed from the edit-key guard. The focus check already excludes it.
  - Updater tests: upstream now checks release URLs against `repoOwner/repoName`, so the test fixtures use the fork's release URLs.
  - `README.md`: documented `ctrl+y` / `ctrl+x` for upstream's new key-binding docs-parity test.
  - Test isolation: `pkg/export` TestMain unsets `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (a real wrangler login leaked in). `tests/e2e` TestMain unsets `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`, because nix shells export 1980-01-01 and that pins bv's robot clock. `pkg/drift` `TestDrift_NewEmitterSemantics` now pins its probe analyzer to the test clock; it started failing on 2026-10-01 because its 2026-09-01 fixtures crossed the 30-day staleness limit.
- **Validation:** `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` clean. `go test ./...`: all packages pass except `tests/e2e` `TestRobotCycleSuggestionRepairsImportedTracker`. That test runs the locally installed `br`, whose `dep remove` fails with "database is busy (recovery in progress)", and it fails the same way on pristine upstream v0.25.0.

## September release update

The user requested `library-updater` followed by a new release. Each selected
dependency is researched and tested separately. Local replacements and
pseudo-version pins are preserved except parent-required transitions recorded
below; modules present only in dependency tooling
graphs are distinguished from this project's declared requirements. The raw
registry inventory is `/data/tmp/bv-release-module-inventory-20260911.json`.
Release preparation uses DSR/RCH and the complete repository release gate;
GitHub Actions must not run. Existing incomplete P1/native evidence remains open.

### Published release evidence

`v0.25.0` was published at **2026-09-12T19:39:38Z** from
`87cee25886915ab1d072d807abc234b743899f7c`. The complete clean-source gate
passed all ten stages in 1833 seconds, with zero failures or skips, on
vmi1264463 using Go 1.26.8 and isolated br 0.6.0. The eligible receipt and log
are `/data/tmp/bv-release-gate-20260912T185754Z.lb7mwm/{receipt.json,gate.log}`;
local pre-packaging evidence is `/data/tmp/bv-v0.25.0-qualified-evidence-20260912/`.
The frozen reference was built and compared; no stored-reference fallback ran.

Strict RCH packaging completed in 242.090 seconds, sealed all five archives and
passed its final `verify` operation. Every embedded binary has the exact source
revision, `vcs.modified=false`, Go 1.26.8 and CGO disabled. Subsequent standalone
verification attempts were refused by RCH memory-pressure admission (exit 103),
without local fallback; the completed package verification is the release proof.
Logs: `/tmp/bv-release-package-v0250-20260912.log` and the two
`/tmp/bv-release-verify-v0250*20260912.log` attempts.

The upload set at `/data/tmp/bv-v0.25.0-release-assets-20260912/` contains exactly
14 files: five archives, five individual checksums, `checksums.txt`, `SHA256SUMS`,
the sealed receipt and an SPDX 2.3 SBOM with 60 packages from the actual Linux
binary. DSR uploaded the draft with `--verify-tag --no-dispatch`. Every draft
file was downloaded and compared by hash, size and name before publication;
`/data/tmp/bv-v0250-draft-verification-20260912.json` records the result. All 14
public API digests also match. No signing key was available; no signature claim
is made. GitHub Actions remained disabled in all three publishing repositories.

The packaged binary passed real desktop/mobile/offline/update browser journeys
and negative controls (`/tmp/bv-v0250-packaged-browser-20260912.log`, retained
artifacts `/data/tmp/bv-browser-smoke.jAelix`). Linux amd64 and macOS arm64 passed
all shell-installer archive controls, live public installation, capabilities,
tiny-source readiness JSON, self-update from 0.24.1 and no-update checks. Logs
are `/tmp/bv-v0250-{linux,mac}-*20260912.log`. The tiny-source fixture has no live
tracker metadata, so its correct result proves readiness but emits no claim.
Windows amd64 passed the complete default native installer suite, including
live install, tiny project, self-update/no-update and failed-install preservation;
`/tmp/bv-v0250-windows-live-20260912.log`, remote evidence
`C:\Users\jeffr\bv-v0250-native-20260912-1642\live-installer-v0250-1940`.
The controlled source-version negative fixture is not a native source-build proof.

Homebrew `4b2e5aa` and Scoop `c06a555` publish the sealed hashes on main and their
legacy mirrors; public file bytes match local files. Ruby syntax and formula
validation passed on macOS (Ruby is absent locally); its existing Hardware::CPU
branch style produces one heuristic warning. UBS on the formula passed with
zero critical/warning findings. Scoop JSON and its archive identity passed.
These checks do not claim native Homebrew/Scoop installation. Go proxy `.info`
points to the exact tagged revision and `.mod` matches the tag. The unchanged
Nix flake was evaluated for all four platforms at version 0.25.0 using Go 1.26.7
(`/tmp/bv-release-flake-v0250-platforms-20260912.json`); this is not a Nix build.
P1 completion, native source-build acceptance and native macOS amd64/Linux arm64
execution remain outside the completed release proof.

The publication-only documentation diff passes whitespace and progress-JSON
validation. UBS selected a Bash module for the Markdown/JSON set, scanned zero
files and exited 2 with a module environment error
(`/tmp/bv-v0250-publication-docs-ubs-20260912.log`); this is not a clean scan.

The remaining paragraphs retain preparation history. Their pending statements
describe intermediate checkpoints, not the final published status above.

The `f6e7e899` gate at `/data/tmp/bv-release-gate-20260912T181541Z.wkK2wu`
passed unit race tests, watched exports, documentation parity and the real WASM
rebuild. E2E failed the correlation window at 15.003351592 seconds against its
unchanged 15-second limit and live saved-claim guards with the worker's br
0.5.12. The known-failed gate was stopped during benchmarks; its receipt is
ineligible. The unchanged correlation test then passed three race-enabled
repetitions (`/tmp/bv-correlation-qualification-20260912.log`).

An isolated official br 0.6.0 binary was verified against its release checksum
and asset digest, without replacing the shared tracker or migrating its database.
With that binary first on PATH, live tracker tests passed three race-enabled
repetitions in 88.907 seconds (`/tmp/bv-live-tracker-qualification-20260912.log`).
README and release prerequisites now state this saved-claim requirement. A new
complete gate still must pass; these focused checks do not replace it.

The diagnostic gate on `b218b119` at
`/data/tmp/bv-release-gate-20260912T165140Z.QtxK0l` failed the Cass timeout
test (repaired in `f851d15c`), the frozen correlation E2E timing assertion
(21.369 seconds against 15 seconds), generated environment documentation
parity, and the graph rebuild because that worker lacked its configured Cargo
registry cache. These results do not authorize packaging. The `f851d15c` run
on hz3 uses a verified Cargo cache and passed build/vet plus all unit race
tests; its source still contains the stale documentation row, so it also
cannot qualify the corrected release source. The documentation correction
preserves the existing production behavior and needs a new complete receipt.

The corrected `a35fc2a3` run at
`/data/tmp/bv-release-gate-20260912T173325Z.XfSKbe` passed formatting,
build/vet, all unit race tests (228 seconds), documentation parity and the real
offline graph-WASM rebuild (23 seconds). Its E2E suite failed only the second
`invalid-sqlite` watched-export publication's unchanged 15-second deadline.
The watcher had detected the change and entered database export. This does
not establish the cause of the delay. The known-failed gate was interrupted
with SIGTERM to its verified owned process group 1018351 during benchmarks;
its incomplete receipt and logs remain diagnostic, never eligible for release.

A retained pre-batching executable exported a one-issue fixture locally under
`strace`: 80 export filesystem sync calls, totaling 0.072515 seconds (largest
0.007058 seconds), in a 0.222-second traced command. Evidence remains at
`/data/tmp/bv-export-sync-baseline.axx8Xu`. This demonstrates reducible work,
not the cause of the earlier worker timeout. FTS, materialized-view and
metadata writes are now prepared as separate transactions, with durability
pragmas, VACUUM placement and timeout assertions unchanged. Three regression
tests force real SQLite failures after successful earlier writes and verify
rollback. Their remote verification and repeated watch tests remain pending.
The hz3 admission retry was refused under critical disk pressure (RCH-I002,
exit 103); no local build fallback ran. A worker with adequate space is being
prepared at vmi1264463 for the remaining qualification.

The three rollback regressions all failed against `a35fc2a3` with only the
new tests overlaid: metadata left two rows instead of the original sentinel,
and FTS/materialized-view errors left partial schema. Strict RCH used verified
Go 1.26.8 on vmi1264463, exit 2 in 73.099 seconds;
`/tmp/bv-export-batch-negative-vmi126-20260912.log`. The earlier traced remote
watch attempt was stopped during compilation (verified owned process group
3248046); it provides no watched-export timing evidence. Both interrupted
diagnostic runs and their artifacts remain preserved.

The batching candidate passed all three rollback regressions ten times with
the race detector (5.563 seconds), the full export race suite (62.698 seconds),
and all six watched-source cases three times under their unchanged deadlines
(93.027 seconds). Build and vet also passed. Strict RCH returned exit 0 in
312.909 seconds on vmi1264463; log
`/tmp/bv-export-batch-candidate-vmi126-20260912.log`, baseline `a35fc2a3`,
overlay fingerprint `e1f96ebc9cfd499b9b672430c743e961a3760710db048886e2cfb15945c8740e`.
The remote-built diagnostic executable was copied locally for the same one-issue
export trace: sync calls fell from 80 to 40. Observed sync time was 0.072515
versus 0.041586 seconds; these single traced runs are not latency quantiles or
proof of the original worker stall's cause. Both traces and the comparison
JSON remain in `/data/tmp/bv-export-sync-baseline.axx8Xu`.
The full UBS scan of the four changed Go files ran through RCH and reported
one critical finding, zero warnings and 143 informational items. The finding
is the already reviewed umask-test taint false positive: the analyzer conflates
the child's environment-derived mask with the parent's separate literal mask
argument. The fixed shell program passes the mask and executable as quoted
positional arguments, and its existing suppression explains this boundary.
No new critical finding was introduced. UBS exit 1 (Make exit 2) is retained
in `/tmp/bv-export-batch-ubs-20260912.log`; no clean scanner exit is claimed.

### github.com/charmbracelet/x/ansi v0.11.7 → v0.11.8

Affected-package and focused integration testing passed; final full-suite
qualification remains pending. Upstream source
is tag `ansi/v0.11.8`, commit `00c6608f106b9c6cd8a1a77156f7901f41265e64`.
[Upstream comparison](https://github.com/charmbracelet/x/compare/ansi/v0.11.7...ansi/v0.11.8).

- The upstream patch changes `WcWidth` codepoint summation and corrects Kitty
  `Quite` to `Quiet` while retaining the deprecated writing field. No direct
  BV callers of those APIs were found; the active wrapping paths use grapheme
  widths. No migration was needed for the candidate.
- `go get` changed only the ANSI requirement and its two checksum lines.
  Vendor is deliberately not refreshed yet; candidate tests use `-mod=mod`.
- Initial RCH attempts failed downloading Go 1.25.5, before compilation. A
  fresh worker SDK copy was verified against the existing SDK's Go executable
  SHA256, `d29b19f04e57fa2f35d4725a8743b663289ac29832128a235c4a3f76f885b150`.
- Baseline revision `4a68abd8` reported failures in
  `TestAgentsE2E_AcceptFlow` and `TestExportPagesWatchUsesLoadedSource`.
  The former still expects `br --status=in_progress`, although the production
  blurb and its unit tests use `br --claim`. The E2E assertion is corrected in
  the canonical checkout; focused verification subsequently passed below.
- The full local disk interrupted baseline result capture. All candidate
  non-E2E packages passed; the completed E2E run failed its stale assertion,
  hit SQLITE_BUSY during watched export, then exhausted the aggregate ten-minute
  timeout while running the 5k/10k search evaluation. Remote exit was 1 after
  822.967 seconds (including compilation). Neither source has a passing suite.
- A full clone was staged at `/tmp/bv-release-20260912` during disk exhaustion.
  Work subsequently returned to the canonical checkout; that retained clone
  is now stale. No source or cache files were deleted.
- RCH status at 00:55 UTC reported zero healthy workers and zero available
  slots. A focused retry was refused with RCH-I001; local fallback is disabled.
  Agent Mail also refuses writes with DISK_FULL. Logs are under
  `/tmp/bv-release-baseline-fixes*-20260912.log` and
  `/tmp/bv-rch-status-20260912.json`.
- About 1 GB became available externally; no files were deleted by this agent.
  A successful independent probe with `XDG_STATE_HOME` on `/tmp` isolated the
  SSH-state failure to local storage. Scheduler admission still failed at
  01:04 UTC despite recovering circuits; no local build was substituted.
- Prepared a SQLite publication fix in the existing exporter: construct a
  private database, close it and rename it onto the published path. Added a
  duplicate-primary-key failure regression proving preservation of the previous
  database, followed by successful replacement. Remote verification is pending.
  This does not make the whole JSON/SQLite/chunk bundle atomic. On Windows an
  open SQLite reader can still prevent rename; the old database is preserved
  and the exporter returns an error. Native Windows watch success is unverified.
- Latest `x/image` 0.46.0, `x/net` 0.59.0 and `x/sync` 0.23.0 require Go 1.26.0
  according to their official proxy manifests. That toolchain change must be
  tested separately before advancing these requirements.

### golang.org/x/sys v0.47.0 → v0.48.0

After Go 1.26.8 passed all `pkg`, `cmd`, and `internal` tests, the isolated
`x/sys` update passed the UI, loader, watcher, analysis, instance, and export
suites remotely. No API migration was required. RCH exit 0 in 118.773 seconds;
log `/tmp/bv-upgrade-sys-tests-20260912.log`, overlay fingerprint
`16ceba78f516c780682e0c3b54e4bc26e5ecd909bf884a4cdd4e86b4decfda88`.

### golang.org/x/sync v0.22.0 → v0.23.0

Upstream adds rejection of negative semaphore capacity; BV uses errgroup and
singleflight and needs no migration. The workspace, correlation, loader, and
search suites passed with `-race -count=1`, remote exit 0 in 108.587 seconds.
Log: `/tmp/bv-upgrade-sync-tests-20260912.log`.

### golang.org/x/term v0.45.0 → v0.46.0

The upstream change preserves partial ReadLine bytes on error; BV's terminal
detection API is unchanged. Full cmd/bv, UI and export suites passed remotely
in 205.834 seconds. Log `/tmp/bv-upgrade-term-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`5a17db0541e6c250eea08b7f714f7997da67a674d5d4de27fac80aa5aa922a08`.

### golang.org/x/text v0.41.0 → v0.42.0

Upstream normalization corrections cover non-BMP/Hangul, combining marks and
short buffers. No BV API migration was needed. Full UI/export suites and the
upstream normalization/cases suites passed remotely in 111.392 seconds. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-text-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`56796295a5b0ab4b4f3d50ff047688712190bf18c4fc87e53501078922c2c950`.
The solver downloaded tools 0.49/mod 0.41 graph requirements; neither became
a newly declared BV requirement.

### golang.org/x/image v0.45.0 → v0.46.0

The upstream diff only changes module metadata. BV's full export suite passed
remotely in 70.145 seconds, with no code or expectation changes. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-image-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`6ce128ec57bb2163dfa12400f09181a8f2e3f7e843accb38c94374b87cfa84ca`.

### golang.org/x/net v0.58.0 → v0.59.0

BV uses the HTML packages; the selected parser changes preserve semantics.
The full UI/export and upstream html/atom/charset suites passed remotely in
140.561 seconds. Log `/tmp/bv-upgrade-net-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`5df7a2057d29baaac2baabd37aa43e50b517f4fc49ea53f9a62256d4fef88753`.
Upstream HTTP/QUIC changes are not BV runtime improvements.

### github.com/charmbracelet/x/xpty v0.1.3 → v0.1.4

The updated helper requires Go 1.25 and fixes Windows process exit/cancellation
reporting. Upstream Linux process tests and BV's full UI suite passed remotely
in 98.697 seconds. No native Windows behavior is established by this result.
Log `/tmp/bv-upgrade-xpty-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`a17d5547a1533210797a9ea99202416f5a859920cda94da39a9d67b1ade1c28b`.

### github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal v1.14.1 → v1.16.0

The module raises its Go floor to 1.25. The reachable fmtsort change uses the
equivalent reflect.Pointer name; no BV migration was needed. Upstream fmtsort
and kr/pretty plus BV recipe/workspace tests passed remotely in 40.153 seconds.
Log `/tmp/bv-upgrade-internal-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`9175ad69db194a0d60438db9aaec14d4d9181b331d5ed3952a4f70c640f9e251`.

### modernc.org/gc/v3 v3.1.3 → v3.1.5

The generated-source parser budget increases with input size; no BV runtime
API changes. Upstream scanner tests passed 11,079 files. Parser tests passed
8,479 of 8,562 files, with 83 upstream-defined skips and no failures. The
match-all `-re=.` flag preserves corpus selection while disabling upstream
report-file rewriting. Remote exit 0 in 95.636 seconds; log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-gc-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`863a62d84cd470da6ef6fcfcb0f6daf7fc5c9dbd03a7b7b5b61de9ac903b3338`.

### SQLite v1.52.0 → v1.58.0 with its required support libraries

SQLite's own go.mod selects libc 1.75.6 and memory 1.12.1; that exact libc pair
is retained instead of unrelated latest 1.75.7. The parent also requires pprof
`v0.0.0-20260802141513-ef3492d7dac3`, the only intentional pseudo-pin change.
Full export/loader/UI race suites passed remotely in 229.297 seconds, followed
by the four watched-export/historical-rejection E2E cases in 138.439 seconds.
Logs `/tmp/bv-upgrade-sqlite-tests-20260912.log` and
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-sqlite-e2e-20260912.log` share overlay
`05775f20140181783ed26304db81ffda0c50d362692e079ee4be63d2e2244835`.
No new SQLite options or DSN behavior were introduced. Native Windows watch
replacement remains unqualified; final vendored/full release gates remain open.

### Dependency research (qualification tracked above)

- Go `x/sys`, `x/term`, `x/sync`, `x/text`, `x/image`, and `x/net` targets
  require Go 1.26.0. The intended toolchain is the maintained 1.26.8 patch.
  Update order is sys, sync, term, text, image, net after a separate toolchain
  qualification. Net selects crypto 0.57 in the module graph; BV vendors no
  crypto packages, so upstream SSH fixes are not a demonstrated BV security fix.

  [net](https://github.com/golang/net/compare/v0.58.0...v0.59.0).
  Text normalization changes merit Unicode rendering checks; BV's used term,
  sync, HTML and image APIs have no required migration.
- go-internal 1.16 raises its floor to Go 1.25. The reachable fmtsort change
  uses the equivalent reflect.Pointer spelling. xpty 0.1.4 also requires
  Go 1.25 and corrects Windows child-exit/cancellation reporting; Linux tests
  cannot qualify that Windows path. gc/v3 3.1.5 keeps Go 1.23 and increases
  its generated-source parser budget, without changing SQLite query behavior.
- `go mod why -m` confirms xpty is used by huh's tests, go-internal by the
  yaml/check test chain, and gc/v3 by libc/ccgo tests. They are requirements
  reachable through upstream tests, not imported BV runtime packages. Evidence:
  `/tmp/bv-module-why-20260912.log`.
- Release prerequisites staged separately on vmi1152480: Go 1.26.8 under
  `/data/tmp/bv-release-go1.26.8-20260912`, GoReleaser 2.18.1 and PowerShell
  7.6.6 under `/data/tmp/bv-release-tools-20260912`. Archive SHA256s matched
  official Go release metadata and GitHub release asset digests before unpacking.
  Both release tools executed their version commands successfully. No project
  build or gate pass is implied by these prerequisite checks.

- `go-colorful` 1.4.1 corrects the D50-to-D65 matrix. Its complete upstream
  comparison is `/tmp/bv-colorful-compare-20260912.json`.
- `go-isatty` 0.0.24 switches affected Unix terminal detection to TIOCGWINSZ,
  adds a Haiku stub and lowers its Go floor; comparison retained in
  `/tmp/bv-isatty-compare-20260912.json`.
- Rust graph updates should start with getrandom 0.4.3, which removes the
  WASI dependency chains, followed by a fresh lockfile inventory. Serde
  1.0.229 and serde_json 1.0.151 are candidates. Updating wasm-bindgen
  0.2.121 to 0.2.128 requires matching CLI, generated JS/WASM and provenance
  changes; the current source-verification script explicitly pins 0.2.121.
- Verified WASM tools are now staged on vmi1152480 beneath
  `/data/tmp/bv-release-tools-20260912`: bindgen executable
  `wasm-bindgen-0.2.128/wasm-bindgen` SHA256
  `dc9e4f1e03996c26fb8bfedfded73d81120a37251c3f19eb87bb460f1f89a5be`,
  and `binaryen-132/binaryen-version_132/bin/wasm-opt` SHA256
  `1014958e6f20d412f1542320b43970214b0fb1ed780595e8f7c0d8761ed53725`.
  Their version commands match the intended pins; the Rust nightly and wasm32
  target are already installed. No WASM source qualification is implied yet.

### Final Go module cleanup

Native `go mod tidy` completed after the SQLite tests and removed requirements
no longer needed by BV: gc/v3 and pprof, plus temporary transitive requirements
from explicitly testing upstream helpers. The selected SQLite module graph
still carries its own pprof revision; it is no longer a direct BV pin. Final
vendor and full-suite checks must qualify this tidied tree.

### Rust getrandom 0.4.2 → 0.4.3

Native Cargo updated only getrandom and pruned 26 obsolete package identities
after removing its WASI 2/3 dependency edges. Existing nightly pin and features
are preserved. Both Rust components' release-profile tests passed via RCH:
206 graph unit tests, 25 graph integration tests, and 3 scorer tests. Remote
exit 0 in 97.153 seconds; `/tmp/bv-upgrade-getrandom-tests-20260912.log`,
overlay `8f149245ff00d93db3fe5abbaa91a6a83c35ada1b73b569834e9f7cd98370545`.
The new Make target uses the graph's dated compiler pin selected by cwd.

### Rust serde_json 1.0.149 → 1.0.151

Updated in both locks. Upstream tightens enum object-key parsing; no BV API
migration was required. All 234 existing graph/scorer release-profile tests
passed remotely in 70.336 seconds; `/tmp/bv-upgrade-serdejson-tests-20260912.log`,
overlay `9f133a83df51f0e02a20e35c83b8980db1b97228ea8e41c96f6cb5082623753e`.

### Rust serde/core/derive 1.0.228 → 1.0.229

Both locks selected the matching serde trio and its required Syn 3.0.5.
All 234 existing graph/scorer release-profile tests passed remotely in
71.776 seconds; `/tmp/bv-upgrade-serde-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`3a8fbf498d891738e48480770cbc8767cb5547b8c15114f5a649f34685ccb3c8`.
No application code or test expectations changed for the macro transition.

### Rust wasm-bindgen 0.2.121 → 0.2.128 cohort

Cargo selected matching macro/shared crates, js-sys 0.3.105, futures 0.4.78,
and test 0.3.78. Both Rust components passed all 234 existing release-profile
tests; `/tmp/bv-upgrade-bindgen-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`420289a10e3135704b1c8e6b16ff4fa13a20de0f748619a94dbcd9b8d6de677f`.
The build script and prerequisite docs now pin the verified 0.2.128 CLI.
Embedded JS/WASM and manifest are intentionally still pending regeneration
after the remaining lock changes; native Rust tests do not qualify those assets.

### Rust async-trait 0.1.89 → 0.1.92

The helper adopts Syn 3 and corrects reference-receiver mutability handling;
Cargo removed the graph lock's final Syn 2 entry. All 234 release-profile tests
passed remotely in 84.976 seconds. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-async-trait-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`d9e019adb68460b85f49ab280e41ef7640a60870fff95819492662b852a20a23`.

### Rust proc-macro2 1.0.106 → 1.0.107

The compiler-floor adjustment requires no BV source migration. Both locks
updated, and all 234 release-profile tests passed remotely in 67.397 seconds.
Log `/tmp/bv-upgrade-procmacro-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`ab33614e75c8a6c88cf34d6c024e45929944c4dfd3650ba8badb24ec6d2e9634`.

### Rust quote 1.0.45 → 1.0.47

Generated-token handling changed upstream; existing macro consumers needed
no application migration. All 234 release-profile tests passed remotely in
66.793 seconds. Log `/tmp/bv-upgrade-quote-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`a456bce770a4041e25e35e8d7225163a1108cef3b81bf42b7ee929f210e069d4`.

### Rust memchr 2.8.0 → 2.8.3

Upstream fixes big-endian AArch64 and a lower-level unsafe API; no evidence
establishes that BV reaches the latter defect. Both locks updated and all 234
release-profile tests passed remotely in 84.714 seconds. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-memchr-tests-20260912.log`, overlay
`e2393a27e573d75c4be52790ca49d3547bc47eeb1f28c745e6057604bfb01ac2`.

The concurrent commit sweep landed work through `2acf8f04` during the updates.
Those commits are retained, but are not release qualification. Subsequent RCH
tests use that base plus explicit overlays, including the now-smaller vendor
tree. The sweep was asked to hold further release commits/publication.

### Rust zmij 1.0.21 → 1.0.23

The float formatter now selects compressed tables at optimization levels s/z.
Both actual release profiles (graph s, scorer 3) passed all 234 existing tests
through RCH in 82.813 seconds. Log `/tmp/bv-upgrade-zmij-tests-20260912.log`,
base `2acf8f04`, overlay
`448d7a786dc5d0a6cdecd4516a0e6e6b780ae71bd8cfce88020653dbe92a2505`.

### Rust bumpalo 3.20.2 → 3.20.3

Upstream allocation rollback and panic/drop corrections require no BV API
migration. Optional allocator-API fixes are not evidence of exposed BV UB.
All 234 release-profile tests passed remotely in 89.098 seconds. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-bumpalo-tests-20260912.log`, base `2acf8f04`, overlay
`94aa1b317879f63cfb74ab35bfb0254cc732db07355cc22586a48f26efa11f0e`.

### Rust rustversion 1.0.22 → 1.0.23

The compiler probe now sets RUSTVERSION=1. Both locks updated, and all 234
release-profile tests passed remotely in 130.578 seconds. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-rustversion-tests-20260912.log`, base `2acf8f04`, overlay
`204b368f7d629e8f40f84240ddfd3316693fa5b10830aeb97cdb4fc184191c6b`.

### Rust futures core/task/util 0.3.32 → 0.3.34

The coupled crates were updated together. Their broader iterator/waker/leak
fixes are not evidence of reachable BV defects; js-sys uses FutureExt. All
234 release-profile tests passed remotely in 99.890 seconds. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-futures-tests-20260912.log`, base `2acf8f04`, overlay
`535bdd999a975c164f2cef78b8726b32806ec673a742aa376d16c1e2dbf1c583`.

### Rust libc 0.2.186 → 0.2.189

Platform bindings and Windows time-symbol linkage change upstream; Linux
qualification does not establish native Windows behavior. All 234 release-profile
tests passed remotely in 102.529 seconds. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-rust-libc-tests-20260912.log`, base `2acf8f04`, overlay
`f8d720a6700a8db80c2cdff0bbae02ad498d33b81839780a9448b5a49101d4c3`.

### Rust autocfg 1.5.0 → 1.5.1

Upstream improves test-wrapper portability; no application migration. All 234
release-profile tests passed remotely in 73.584 seconds. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-autocfg-tests-20260912.log`, base `2acf8f04`, overlay
`2d482d5547f85908dd495897d0dd703f4799391310cf53a83a282e326b35c435`.

### Rust cc 1.2.62 → 1.4.5 with required shlex/find-msvc-tools

Cargo selected shlex 2.0.1 and find-msvc-tools 0.1.12 as cc requires. All 234
release-profile tests passed remotely in 85.273 seconds. Log
`/tmp/bv-upgrade-cc-tests-20260912.log`, base `2acf8f04`, overlay
`19f805dcc5d4c2c41fc74f13f7be3b8ad6bce1ea8761ca9fe7f1e7767f3b9da2`.
This helper chain belongs to minicov's conditional coverage support; normal
graph/scorer tests do not qualify that optional coverage path.

### Final Rust dependency audits

Cargo-audit 0.22.2 checked 1,243 RustSec advisories with no vulnerabilities or
warnings in either lock (51 graph and 20 scorer package entries). The retained
database is commit `b50980aad8b8f14f77e25a97b32dd94bf008b0af`. Audit used
`--no-fetch --no-yanked`; a separate official crates.io metadata check verified
all 50 registry package checksums and that none is yanked. No advisories were
ignored and no target/severity filters applied. Below-latest exceptions are
parent-required minicov 0.3.8, r-efi 6.0.0, and windows-link 0.2.1.
Evidence: `/tmp/bv-rust-audit-{graph,scorer}-20260912.json` and
`/tmp/bv-rust-registry-audit-20260912.json` (includes exact lock hashes).

### Graph artifact refresh

The strict RCH candidate build passed in 77.800 seconds, using the pinned
nightly compiler, wasm-bindgen 0.2.128 and Binaryen 132. Both actual outputs
were downloaded and hashed before replacing the shipped pair; the old pair
and manifest remain at `/data/tmp/bv-release-graph-pair-before-20260912`.
Receipt: `/tmp/bv-release-graph-candidate-receipt-20260912.json`.
Source fingerprint: `1fdf29973770716aa220520e3e4ecc275e324227ae2a482f91644ccbcbadccf7`.
Glue: `93de4c67d0c240662dec03efe48107aefef296e0379be55b3a0f494f94262aa5`.
WASM: `833799c32a00ba2ae16aa6caced25347c709b4b8be2ba9661074d8bd7468076e`.
All 15 manifest entries pass the local hash check. The full two-home harness
passed through strict RCH in 268.950 seconds: identical assets from two physical
compiler homes, all five graph fixtures with 12 metrics and independent Go
goldens/viewer HITS checks, JS fallback, and all negative controls.
Log: `/tmp/bv-release-graph-reproducibility-20260912.log`; base `2acf8f04`,
overlay `5c7d1912e37adaed526dd715afb34e15fe8790b1aa83337fd498a568060f1f72`.
Verified receipts: `/tmp/bv-release-graph-verified-{a,b}-20260912.json`.
This is Node WebAssembly execution, not a browser qualification.

The first two attempts stopped before compilation because RCH's isolated
Cargo home lacked a registry, then the explicitly selected root cache lacked
locked packages. A dedicated cache was populated with `cargo fetch --locked`;
the successful build remained offline and locked. Original failure logs are
retained as `/tmp/bv-release-wasm-candidate{,-cache}-20260912.log`.

### Final Go vulnerability audit

`govulncheck` 1.8.0 checked `./...` with Go 1.26.8 and reported
`No vulnerabilities found.` The strict RCH command exited zero in 52.889
seconds. Log: `/tmp/bv-release-go-audit-20260912.log`; base `2acf8f04`,
overlay `cc9d31ace64ed5ee55fcc55c5d7cc0a176a7e237fb9a830a949a7d27388727d4`.
The audit tool runs outside the application's module requirements.

Reconciliation with the original registry inventory leaves only intentional
exceptions among declared requirements: Chroma remains the local patched
2.24.1 module rather than upstream 2.27.0; the pinned golden/slice, terminfo
and x/exp revisions remain preserved under the skill's version rule; libc
stays at SQLite's required 1.75.6 rather than independently taking 1.75.7.
Modules used only by dependency tooling are not promoted into BV requirements.

### Release execution remaining

- [x] Rust: update getrandom 0.4.3 first and verify removal of obsolete WASI
  chains; then serde_json 1.0.151, serde 1.0.229 and bindgen 0.2.128 cohorts.
- [x] Rust: reinspect the solver result, then update remaining eligible
  proc-macro2 1.0.107, quote 1.0.47, async-trait 0.1.92, memchr 2.8.3,
  zmij 1.0.23, bumpalo 3.20.3, rustversion 1.0.23, futures 0.3.34,
  libc 0.2.189, autocfg 1.5.1 and cc 1.4.5, testing each transition.
  Serde/bindgen require Syn 3.0.5; cc requires shlex 2.0.1 and
  find-msvc-tools 0.1.12. Preserve exact minicov 0.3.8 and parent-constrained
  r-efi 6.0.0/windows-link 0.2.1. Each transition passed all 234 release-profile tests.
- [x] Both Rust crates pass formatting and Clippy with warnings denied.
  Remote logs: `/tmp/bv-release-{graph,scorer}-clippy-20260912.log`.
- [x] Audit both Rust locks against RustSec and verify official registry checksums/yank status.
- [x] Go vulnerability audit reports no vulnerabilities; see the retained command above.
- [x] Benchmark comparator self-tests pass, including failure controls. These
  synthetic controls are not performance measurements. Log:
  `/tmp/bv-release-benchmark-comparator-20260912.log`; retained fixtures:
  `/data/tmp/bv-bench-test.afArWZ`.
- [x] Generate and review both graph assets, copy actual receipt values into
  the manifest, then run fresh source verification and the existing two-home
  reproducibility/graph fixture harness. The existing scripts passed through
  the new Make targets and strict RCH as recorded above.
- [x] Verify the stale assertion correction and diagnose watched-export failure.
- [x] Complete affected-package verification for ANSI and the exporter fix.
- [x] Run the complete vendored race suite with the documented E2E budget;
  retain its two failures and verify both repaired packages fully afterward.
- [ ] Obtain a passing complete clean-source release-gate receipt after the
  required scan and final version/changelog commit.
- [x] Refresh vendor through a fresh staging directory, preserving old files.
  Old tree retained at `/data/tmp/bv-vendor-before-20260912`; native candidate
  at `/data/tmp/bv-vendor-candidate-20260912` copied into vendor. The result is
  159 MB versus 257 MB previously. Final patch-parity/full tests are pending.
- [ ] Validate new Make release targets through strict RCH using a complete,
  sanitized Git clone; transfer Git history and tracked Beads data.
- [x] Align source installers, README, Go tooling and Nix lock with the final
  Go minimum; retain historical benchmark toolchain identities unchanged.
- [x] Run the complete installed UBS through strict RCH, including its Go
  lifecycle helper. Review its findings and rerun after documenting the fixed
  shell program's quoted-argument false positive; final result recorded below.
- [ ] Preserve the complete original release gate, benchmark thresholds and
  provenance checks. Retrieve receipts and archives outside the source tree.
- [x] Resolve local disk exhaustion and fleet admission; continue monitoring space.

No version/tag bump or new release publication has occurred.

### Final vendored race-suite repair

The first final run found two test failures. All other packages passed, including
the complete E2E suite in 750.627 seconds. Overall remote exit was 1 after
947.906 seconds, so this is a failed full-suite run.
Log: `/tmp/bv-release-final-go-race-20260912.log`.

- `TestCachedCorrelator_SingleflightLogsSharedErrors` observed two underlying
  calls instead of one. Its `started` counter precedes a real Git lookup, so
  sleeping 50 ms does not establish that both callers joined the same flight.
  The test now uses `testing/synctest` to wait for both callers to block before
  releasing the shared error. It retains the real Git lookup, both calls and
  all error/count/shared-log assertions. This is logical-clock concurrency
  verification, not a wall-clock latency claim.
- `TestBackgroundWorker_HugeDatasetOpenOnly` exhausted its five-second polling
  wait. It now executes the real generation-fenced refresh synchronously before
  asserting the 20k-row tier, filtered counts, hidden closed/tombstone authority,
  absent prerequisites and metadata-only rebuilds. It no longer asserts a
  five-second async completion bound. Existing refresh/coalescing/Phase2 tests
  and the separate performance acceptance criteria remain unchanged.

Both test-only repairs pass three race-enabled executions through strict RCH
(correlation 1.841 seconds, huge-tier UI 23.109 seconds; 120.488 seconds total
including compilation). Log: `/tmp/bv-release-race-repairs-focused-20260912.log`,
base `2acf8f04`, overlay
`f61cf2711f4c2b533385e1bff11af753be1320dffe8e8060f9537d0f0e0a731f`.
Both full affected packages subsequently passed with the race detector:
correlation 17.050 seconds and UI 154.350 seconds (259.487 seconds including
compilation). Log: `/tmp/bv-release-race-repaired-packages-20260912.log`,
same base and overlay fingerprint. The failed full run remains failed;
the final complete clean-source release gate is still required.

Final `go build ./...` and `go vet ./...` both passed through strict RCH with
Go 1.26.8, `-mod=vendor` and `CGO_ENABLED=0`. Log:
`/tmp/bv-release-final-build-vet-20260912.log`, same base and overlay fingerprint
as the repaired-package tests. Formatting and `git diff --check` also pass.
The generated clean-overlay archive was moved intact out of the checkout to
`/data/tmp/bv-release-clean-overlay-base-20260912.tar`.

The release remains unpublished. After the user repeated the instruction to
continue in response to the narrow scratch-cleanup question, release checks
resumed with cleanup limited to tools' newly created temporary files. Repository
files and retained evidence remain preserved.

### UBS and v0.25.0 candidate preparation

The complete installed UBS 5.4.2 with its verified Go 7.1.4 module scanned six
task-related Go files through strict RCH, including the Go lifecycle helper.
The first scan reported two critical findings at the same umask test command:
the program is fixed, masks are literal test cases, and arguments are quoted
positional parameters. An inline explanation documents this false positive.
All seven mutex warnings have matching unlocks before assertions/blocking calls;
one already uses deferred Unlock. Informational results are test-parallelism
suggestions, syntax inventories, test error discards and local SQLite calls
without contexts. No production defect was identified in this scan.
Initial log: `/tmp/bv-release-ubs-20260912-1628.log`.
Both final JSONL and text runs retain one critical taint false positive despite
the documented inline suppression; their scanner exit is 1 (Make reports 2).
The analyzer conflates the child branch's environment-derived `mask` with the
parent loop's separate literal `mask`. The command also quotes its positional
parameters rather than interpolating shell code. No clean UBS exit is claimed.
Logs: `/tmp/bv-release-ubs-final-20260912-1630.log` and
`/tmp/bv-release-ubs-text-20260912-1633.log`. This reviewed scanner limitation
does not waive any release-gate stage or change application behavior.
The fallback and Nix version are now v0.25.0; changelog publication stays pending.

### Clean-clone gate and Cass timeout repair

Candidate `b218b119` passed formatting, build/vet and the complete unit race
suite in the first clean-clone attempt (unit stage 395 seconds). During E2E,
the binary's VCS metadata exposed RCH's default in-checkout `.rch-tmp` output.
There was no tracked source diff, but retained helper outputs would prevent a
clean final receipt. Only the verified owned process group was stopped; the
ineligible receipt and log remain at
`/data/tmp/bv-release-gate-interrupted-20260912/`. The remote originals and all
scratch evidence are retained. Release instructions now require an explicit
external remote `TMPDIR`.

The same candidate's fresh-clone rerun confirms `TMPDIR=/data/tmp` and an empty
initial dirty list. It passed formatting/build/vet, then failed only
`TestSearcher_CustomTimeout`: its wall-clock double could select completion
when both its 30 ms timeout and 100 ms simulated-work timers were ready after
scheduling delay. Other unit packages passed. The gate continues remaining
stages for diagnostic coverage; its failure is not an eligible release result.
Log: `/tmp/bv-release-clean-gate-external-tmp-20260912.log`.

Both Cass timeout-option unit tests now use `testing/synctest`, preserving
their original durations and assertions. They additionally require actual
deadline errors; the custom-timeout test verifies the same command succeeds
with the unchanged 200 ms default. This verifies logical timeout semantics
using the existing command double, not real subprocess wall-clock performance.
The custom-timeout repair passed 20 race repetitions and the full Cass package
through strict RCH on hz3 with the supported minimum Go 1.26.0; final combined
tests and the Go 1.26.8 complete release gate remain required.
Log: `/tmp/bv-release-cass-timeout-fix-20260912.log`.
The combined timeout repairs subsequently passed 20 race repetitions and the
full Cass package. Complete UBS scanned the changed file with zero critical
findings, zero warnings and exit 0. Log:
`/tmp/bv-release-cass-timeouts-final-20260912.log`; base `b218b119`, overlay
`18e4630a92613f5b84703d9cbde34c04ea72f34b4a039436ee51b9e1e3b6737f`.

The E2E-built candidate also passed the real desktop/mobile/offline/update
Chromium journey and negative controls. It is a diagnostic CGO-enabled binary
with dirty temporary-file metadata, not a distributable archive. The packaged
binary will repeat this check. Evidence: `/data/tmp/bv-browser-smoke.6wrrlu`;
log `/tmp/bv-release-browser-candidate-20260912.log`.

Nix evaluation reports version 0.25.0 and Go 1.26.7 for x86_64/aarch64 Linux
and Darwin. This is evaluation, not a native Nix build. Evidence:
`/tmp/bv-release-flake-v0250-platforms-20260912.json`.

### Recovery and verification follow-up

- The old exporter fails the new preservation regression as intended:
  `failed rebuild changed published database`, in
  `/tmp/bv-release-sqlite-regression-old-20260912.log`. This establishes a real
  construction-failure bug independent of timing-sensitive watched-export reads.
- RCH recovered automatically after local disk space returned. Its transfer
  setup for the temporary clone changed vmi1152480's `/dp` alias to `/tmp`.
  At 01:18 UTC the incorrect link was preserved at
  `/data/tmp/bv-release-displaced-dp-20260912` and `/dp` was restored to
  `/data/projects`; source data was not changed by this repair. Capabilities
  were refreshed. Build commands now run from the canonical project root;
  `/tmp` is used for staging/cache/state, not as RCH's canonical project root.
- The corrected exporter, preservation regression, claim assertion and unchanged
  watch cases passed three times via strict RCH. Evidence:
  `/tmp/bv-release-fixes-canonical-restored-20260912.log`, remote exit 0.
  Base `42a208ab` and overlay fingerprint
  `caf3c490de1d94cf6c523f6cf48201a8eb2133ec2721576648fd814f49dcc373`
  identify the tested source. Full build and vet passed. Full UI/export packages
  passed with `-count=1` in 24.010/33.545 seconds, respectively;
  `/tmp/bv-upgrade-ansi-affected-tests-20260912.log` records remote exit 0.
- The final E2E gate now grants the aggregate suite 30 minutes. All 600 search
  observations, individual assertions and performance thresholds are preserved.
  Remaining dependency transitions use their affected package/integration suites;
  the complete suite and complete release gate remain mandatory on the final tree.
- Upstream SQLite 1.58.0 specifies libc 1.75.6 exactly. Its generated-code ABI
  compatibility warning makes independent libc 1.75.7 selection inappropriate.
  The paired transition also selects memory 1.12.1 and a newer pprof pseudo-version.
  Those solver-required changes must be recorded together when SQLite is updated.

### go-colorful v1.4.0 → v1.4.1

- [Upstream comparison](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/go-colorful/compare/v1.4.0...v1.4.1)
  corrects the D50-to-D65 matrix. No API removal or BV migration is needed.
  BV and its local forks have no direct D50/ProPhoto callers.
- Complete UI/export suites passed with `-count=1`, 20.006/23.321 seconds;
  strict RCH exit 0 in `/tmp/bv-upgrade-colorful-tests-20260912.log`.
- GitHub repository Actions permissions were read back as `enabled: false`;
  release publication will use DSR without dispatch.

### go-isatty v0.0.22 → v0.0.24

- [Official comparison](https://github.com/mattn/go-isatty/compare/v0.0.22...v0.0.24):
  Unix detection uses TIOCGWINSZ to avoid an OSS ioctl collision; adds a Haiku
  stub and lowers its Go floor to 1.20. No BV API migration required.
- `go get` changes its requirement/checksums only. Upstream terminal tests and
  the full BV UI suite passed via RCH, 0.033/24.999 seconds, remote exit 0 in
  `/tmp/bv-upgrade-isatty-tests-20260912.log`; native Windows is not implied.

### go-runewidth v0.0.24 → v0.0.30

- [Official comparison](https://github.com/mattn/go-runewidth/compare/v0.0.24...v0.0.30):
  fixes spacing marks and grapheme wrapping, sums cluster widths capped at two
  cells, avoids zero-width Wrap division, and lazily initializes width tables.
  Adds TruncatePrefix; existing BV calls require no API migration.
- Complete UI suite and upstream width tests passed without changing rendering
  expectations, 24.431/1.965 seconds; strict RCH exit 0 in
  `/tmp/bv-upgrade-runewidth-tests-20260912.log`.

### fuzzy v0.1.2 → v0.1.3

- [Official comparison](https://github.com/sahilm/fuzzy/compare/v0.1.2...v0.1.3):
  adds iterator APIs and delegates FindFromNoSort through the iterator adapter.
  Existing ordering and match indices are preserved; Go floor remains 1.24.5.
  No source migration required. Full UI/search and upstream matching tests pass,
  20.731/0.129/0.046 seconds; remote exit 0 in
  `/tmp/bv-upgrade-fuzzy-tests-20260912.log`.

### goldmark v1.8.2 → v1.8.6

- [Official comparison](https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/compare/v1.8.2...v1.8.6):
  fixes fenced indentation, link punctuation, percent-escape decoding,
  truncated UTF-8 escaping and segment padding; SVG data URLs are now treated
  as dangerous. No BV API migration identified. Complete UI/export suites pass,
  23.807/44.215 seconds; remote exit 0 in
  `/tmp/bv-upgrade-goldmark-tests-20260912.log`.

### Export permissions review

Independent review found that the pending private-file exporter used Chmod(0644),
overriding a restrictive umask. The subprocess negative control failed as
expected: `database mode under umask 077 = 0644, want 0600`, remote exit 1 in
`/tmp/bv-release-sqlite-umask-negative-20260912.log`. The correction now builds
inside a private temporary directory, letting SQLite apply its original
creation-mode/umask semantics, then renames the closed database. The extended
regression checks both first creation and replacement under masks 077 and 022.
Three executions of SQLite export and existing watch tests passed via RCH,
43.367/86.161 seconds, remote exit 0; evidence is
`/tmp/bv-release-sqlite-umask-fixed-20260912.log`, overlay fingerprint
`545179ca30155477b866892c8d35988eaa5e735ae1a3b5e21344cb938a305588`.
This fixes the unpublished candidate; neither negative control counts as a
dependency compatibility failure.

### Go 1.26 language floor and Go 1.26.8 release toolchain

- [Go 1.26 release notes](https://go.dev/doc/go1.26): default Green Tea GC,
  stack-allocation improvements, TLS defaults, URL validation and HTTP redirect
  changes need actual integration tests, especially the local go-json fork's
  private runtime interfaces. No required production API migration found.
- [1.26.7-to-1.26.8 comparison](https://github.com/golang/go/compare/go1.26.7...go1.26.8)
  contains no newly listed security fix. The Go floor is a language minimum,
  not a recommendation to use an unpatched compiler.
- Source installer checks, README and AGENTS now require Go 1.26. The controlled
  Windows compiler fixture reports 1.26.8 so its wrong-binary test still reaches
  the intended promotion boundary. Historical performance identities are intact.
- Nix moves to the supported 26.05 branch, revision
  `21a67dc470149f337cecafbe965d8d252a390518`, with Go 1.26.7. Official Nix metadata
  established its NAR hash; upstream attributes evaluate for all four existing
  systems. Current unstable drops Intel macOS and was rejected. The actual
  updated BV flake subsequently evaluated for all four systems, with
  GOTOOLCHAIN=local, vendored modules and checks enabled. Exact flake/lock/go.mod
  file hashes matched worker staging and evaluated store source at
  `/data/tmp/bv-flake-evaluation-20260912.YytCLjfd` on hz3. No native Nix build
  has passed; missing nixbld and Intel macOS deprecation warnings are retained.
- Full pkg/cmd/internal suites passed through RCH with SDK 1.26.8, remote exit
  0 after 321.689 seconds; `/tmp/bv-upgrade-go126-tests-20260912.log` binds
  overlay `16731c4b40823d1be30a3a4afc297a4e9dcd8e68ea76daba2329d652419bdca2`.
  The manifest's Go x/* versions were unchanged during this toolchain test.

### Current candidate: x/sys v0.47.0 → v0.48.0

- Official comparison linked above fixes Linux Ifreq alignment and NetBSD AVX
  detection. BV's locking/filesystem interfaces have no required migration.
- Test UI, loader, watcher, analysis, instance and export paths after the update.

**Date:** 2026-06-08 | **Project:** beads_viewer | **Language:** Go | **Release:** v0.17.0

## Summary

- **Updated:** 7 direct Go dependencies (all minor/patch bumps of mature libraries) + transitive `golang.org/x/text` and re-vendored.
- **Method:** Staged by risk — `golang.org/x/*` + `go-runewidth` together (official, near-zero risk), then `modernc.org/sqlite` alone (FTS5 search engine), then `git.sr.ht/~sbinet/gg` alone (graphics/export). Full `go test ./...` gate after the batch; focused `pkg/search` + `pkg/export` (FTS5) gate after the sqlite bump.
- **Failed:** None. **Needs attention:** None.
- **Validation:** `go vet ./...` clean, `gofmt -l` clean, `go test ./...` 27 packages OK / 0 FAIL (with `BV_NO_BROWSER=1 BV_TEST_MODE=1 CGO_CFLAGS=-DSQLITE_ENABLE_FTS5`).

### Direct dependencies

- `git.sr.ht/~sbinet/gg`: `v0.7.0` -> `v0.8.0`
- `github.com/mattn/go-runewidth`: `v0.0.23` -> `v0.0.24`

### Notable indirect dependency updates

- `golang.org/x/text`: `v0.37.0` -> `v0.38.0` (pulled by the x/* bumps)

Remaining outdated entries reported by `go list -m -u` are all transitive-only deps not required by `go mod why` (e.g. `gonum.org/v1/plot`, `honnef.co/go/tools`, `codeberg.org/go-latex/*`); left untouched to keep the release surface minimal.
